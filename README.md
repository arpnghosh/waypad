# waypad
Waypad is a program which aims to prevent idle modes from activating on receiving gamepad/controller input for Wayland  compositors. I wrote this after I became interested in KDE's problem statement, "Make KWin aware of game controllers" for the GSoC 2025.

Currently, it works on sway, with plans to add support for KWin soon.

# Roadmap
- [ ] Add support for KWin
- [ ] Add user configuration support via CLI/GUI
- [ ] Implement button remapping and mouse/keyboard emulation for standard controller layouts
